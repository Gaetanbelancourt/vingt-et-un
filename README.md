# Program Summary: This program implements the game of Vingt-et-un, a simplified version of Blackjack.
# Players take turns drawing from the card deck to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
# The program simulates player vs. computer gameplay.

# IPO Chart:
# Input:
#      - Player's name
#      - Player's choices (see rules, play game, quit)
#      - Player's decisions during the game (stay or hit)
# Processing:
#      - Prompt for and store player'sname
#      - Display menu and process user's choice
#      - If choice is 1, display the rules of the game
#      - If choice is 2, play the game:
#            Initialize game variables
#            Loop through rounds of cards giving for both player and house
#            Check for busts and handle game logic
#            Determine winner or tie based on scores
#            Display results after the game ends
#      - If choice is 3, display a goodbye message and quit
#      - Validate all menu choices and user inputs
#      - Functional decomposition into multiple function
#
# Output:
#      - Rules of the game
#      - Prompts for player's actions during the game
#      - Display of card giving and running totals
#      - Result of each game round (winner, loser, tie)
#      - Good-bye message upon quitting
